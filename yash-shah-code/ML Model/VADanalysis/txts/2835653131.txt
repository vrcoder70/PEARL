The spread of propaganda is what I push back on, this is an insult to the Maisons and what they were put through. These wines are history, and survived on the right side of it. And to insinuate Saison sells “Nazi wine”? No.They wine is bottled a year after the harvest and then aged at least 3 years before being sold. All it takes is an email to your Food &amp; Wine department at the @nypost for even a shred of information about champagne from that time period, or in general♥️@NasJab ♥️@m7mdkurd ♥️♥️♥️Y’all see “1943” (the HARVEST year) and run with it.

I don’t want to encourage women to enter, but I don’t want to put them down. I recently learned about ethical porn, and have finally found the balance on that tricky line: don’t reward the major production companies. Support the performers.Bc you walked into Venetian in 2014 “choosing your rate”? We started the same time- why are you putting me down for making industry standard? I’m not against sex work, I’m against the unethical treatment of MOST sex workers. Great to see you’re thriving tho, wish you the best 🤘🏼 https://t.co/9P8ON5iRu8For all I know, this photographer could’ve actually worked for Vogue. In which case, shame on him for abusing those credentials to explicitly photograph someone clearly in the throes of a crisis while the world ridiculed and watched, and these men capitalized on it.I was a pawn to them, they never  saw me as a human being with a soul and a future. They trafficked me into the hands of this man with no supervision or regards for my safety. I was not paid for that shoot. I was not informed what it would be used for. I had no control.Weeks later, those photos ended up being used on the website BangBros created under my name. Which I owned the domain for before they, again, deceived me into selling to them for $1.I was too young to realize at the time, but these men, all of them, collectively and consciously chose to deceive me. Jordan Sibbs, the Photogralher, other executives at Bang Bros, are all complicit. And I know for a fact they are because...My conclusion (after tons of therapy), is that it would not have mattered if this man was straight, gay, or even a female. I would have felt JUST as unsafe were it a woman in his place. The part of this whole thing that utterly crushes me, was the indignity of it.It is important to note that this man, to me, was sexually ambiguous. To this day, I do not know if he was gay, straight, or on any range of the sexuality spectrum. I have no idea. And it’s not important to me. I have been haunted by this for 6 long years.The worst part of it was when he moved his hands over my breasts telling me how nice they were. I still feel the cold metal from his rings in a shiver down my spine.When I wasn’t posing to his liking, he would physically correct me and contort my body until he was satisfied. I wanted to scream and cry and to claw his face off with my bare hands all at the same time.I dissociated. Instantly. I was fucking terrified. I felt cheap and used, powerless and demeaned.He told me to take the hijab and my underwear off and to pose against a wall. My heart began to palpatate. I know it might be easy for you to say “you had sex on camera, what’s the big deal?” But you need to understand the level of fear a woman has when she feels powerless.After he got the shots he wanted in the hijab, I thought we were done, so I started walking away to find my way back into the building, but he insisted the lighting was ideal for a few more shots he had in mind.His posing orders quickly scaled from provocative to salacious, but again, I was too afraid to say anything. “What if it IS for Vogue? What if he gets mad? What if he pushes you off the roof?” Was the chorus in my head. I didn’t know this man, and I was scared to my core.I was taken to roof of the building (industrial and barely accessible) ALONE with him. I was handed a hijab, &amp; two replica semi-automatic rifles. Following his orders, I put it on and posed for the photos the way he wanted, while he made physical corrections on my body.From the moment I was told there was no hair and makeup I knew something was off, but I was conflicted. I had never been on a “real” set, and I didn’t want to inadvertently insult the photographer or his process, because WHAT IF IT WAS GOING IN VOGUE!The photographers name, I believe, was Christian. I arrived at Bang Bros office HQ not knowing what to expect from a “real photographer,” thinking we would be going to a beautiful set or location.He told me I’d have the opportunity to be featured in mainstream publications and could really validate myself if I worked with this photographer. 

My eyes lit up, I was honored &amp; excited, I thought maybe this terrible situation I’m in could be parlayed into something positive.Following the whirlwind news cycle when the virality of the hijab video was at its peak, Bang Bros executive Jordan Sibbs told me his girlfriend’s relative was in town, a photographer for Vogue magazine.I’ve never spoken about this because I was made to feel as though I couldn’t tell my story without being derided by the general public. 

I feel safe now, and I also feel the need to unload some things that have haunted me during my brief stint in the industry.I implore you to hear my side of it as I’ve recounted in countless interviews since. 

I verbatim told them “you’re going to get me killed.” 

To which they responded with laughter and hopes of virality, and I was left humiliated for speaking up and too afraid to say more. https://t.co/P4KKLobep3I’m still losing my marbles over this support.

The point is I’m terrible with money and will never be rich for that exact reason.I ordered an iPad at 3AM last night so I can continue my MCU marathon on my flight tomorrow 🥲 I don’t have enough room on my phone for two full length films, so I paid $1500 to download movies that will probably be available on the in-flight entertainment 🥲I just love how @AliChater’s YouTube is a Pinterest board for so many people 💕 https://t.co/zpR5xoC9yhWhite man paperwork !!!!

And why movies like Spider-Man aren’t in the timeline order of the MCU?Starting Thor: The Dark World now. Looking forward to Natalie Portman, but definitely not looking forward to the medieval times accent for another 2 hours.But what plot line did I miss that caused Bruce Banner to suddenly be able to control Hulk enough to pose for an Avengers album cover at the end of that movie?Avengers was amazing, I especially loved Scarlett Johansson’s personality. I’m so invested in the Loki / Thor dynamic because I have a soft spot for the black sheeps 🥺Does Loki have mommy issues or daddy issues?@Prophet12_ca The way a baby looks at a grease fire. Unable to understand what is happening, and unable to look away.@Zenorthgerman Timeline order@Editwithmouse If it makes you feel better, I am FULLY aware of how fortunate I am to be an adult experiencing this for the first timeThor was okay.

How’d I do?These sentiments are rampant from industry women. Their envy &amp; resentment towards my noteriety is putrid, I’m told to “be grateful to porn,” and to “shut up and quit social media” if I’m unhappy.

This was around the height of the controversy surrounding the hijab video.I feel bad for her living in such a deluded mindset to believe telling your own personal story &amp; fighting for vulnerable young women that don’t have a voice means you’re chasing clout. 

We are not the same. Stay in your toxic, narrow lane. https://t.co/wyTYMJywfS@KloppSZN_ Only acknowledging this because you’ve so clearly missed the whole point of the post.

You seem like an empathetic father, she’s very lucky to have you looking out for her. Just remember her choices aren’t a reflection of you. My dad was incredible and I had a close, loving upbringing.@blkkenyb It’s what the production company’s LLC was called. Venetian Studios is under the BangBros umbrella.@PeteIsntDunne Thank you for giving me a chance@MariaPoetess It’s a tricky line to walk... I don’t want to encourage women to enter, but I don’t want to put them down. I recently learned about ethical porn, and have finally found the balance on that tricky line: don’t reward the major production companies. Support the performers.Bc you walked into Venetian in 2014 “choosing your rate”? We started the same time- why are you putting me down for making industry standard? I’m not against sex work, I’m against the unethical treatment of MOST sex workers. Great to see you’re thriving tho, wish you the best 🤘🏼 https://t.co/9P8ON5iRu8For all I know, this photographer could’ve actually worked for Vogue. In which case, shame on him for abusing those credentials to explicitly photograph someone clearly in the throes of a crisis while the world ridiculed and watched, and these men capitalized on it.I was a pawn to them, they never  saw me as a human being with a soul and a future. They trafficked me into the hands of this man with no supervision or regards for my safety. I was not paid for that shoot. I was not informed what it would be used for. I had no control.Weeks later, those photos ended up being used on the website BangBros created under my name. Which I owned the domain for before they, again, deceived me into selling to them for $1.I was too young to realize at the time, but these men, all of them, collectively and consciously chose to deceive me. Jordan Sibbs, the Photogralher, other executives at Bang Bros, are all complicit. And I know for a fact they are because...My conclusion (after tons of therapy), is that it would not have mattered if this man was straight, gay, or even a female. I would have felt JUST as unsafe were it a woman in his place. The part of this whole thing that utterly crushes me, was the indignity of it.It is important to note that this man, to me, was sexually ambiguous. To this day, I do not know if he was gay, straight, or on any range of the sexuality spectrum. I have no idea. And it’s not important to me. I have been haunted by this for 6 long years.The worst part of it was when he moved his hands over my breasts telling me how nice they were. I still feel the cold metal from his rings in a shiver down my spine.When I wasn’t posing to his liking, he would physically correct me and contort my body until he was satisfied. I wanted to scream and cry and to claw his face off with my bare hands all at the same time.I dissociated. Instantly. I was fucking terrified. I felt cheap and used, powerless and demeaned.He told me to take the hijab and my underwear off and to pose against a wall. My heart began to palpatate. I know it might be easy for you to say “you had sex on camera, what’s the big deal?” But you need to understand the level of fear a woman has when she feels powerless.After he got the shots he wanted in the hijab, I thought we were done, so I started walking away to find my way back into the building, but he insisted the lighting was ideal for a few more shots he had in mind.His posing orders quickly scaled from provocative to salacious, but again, I was too afraid to say anything. “What if it IS for Vogue? What if he gets mad? What if he pushes you off the roof?” Was the chorus in my head. I didn’t know this man, and I was scared to my core.I was taken to roof of the building (industrial and barely accessible) ALONE with him. I was handed a hijab, &amp; two replica semi-automatic rifles. Following his orders, I put it on and posed for the photos the way he wanted, while he made physical corrections on my body.From the moment I was told there was no hair and makeup I knew something was off, but I was conflicted. I had never been on a “real” set, and I didn’t want to inadvertently insult the photographer or his process, because WHAT IF IT WAS GOING IN VOGUE!The photographers name, I believe, was Christian. I arrived at Bang Bros office HQ not knowing what to expect from a “real photographer,” thinking we would be going to a beautiful set or location.He told me I’d have the opportunity to be featured in mainstream publications and could really validate myself if I worked with this photographer. 

My eyes lit up, I was honored &amp; excited, I thought maybe this terrible situation I’m in could be parlayed into something positive.Following the whirlwind news cycle when the virality of the hijab video was at its peak, Bang Bros executive Jordan Sibbs told me his girlfriend’s relative was in town, a photographer for Vogue magazine.I’ve never spoken about this because I was made to feel as though I couldn’t tell my story without being derided by the general public. 

I feel safe now, and I also feel the need to unload some things that have haunted me during my brief stint in the industry.I implore you to hear my side of it as I’ve recounted in countless interviews since. 

I verbatim told them “you’re going to get me killed.” 

To which they responded with laughter and hopes of virality, and I was left humiliated for speaking up and too afraid to say more. https://t.co/P4KKLobep3I’m still losing my marbles over this support.

Thousands more girls enter the industry with the basis of this romanticized vision because the success stories aren’t honest about both sides. 
The more common one being the cripplingly exploitive side. https://t.co/Ghz5Xnyaid@bereecueto @Juan75471147 I don’t need to know Spanish to know this clap back was elite 😩😩😩😂😂@Tyler_Johnson85 *sent with invisible ink*

How’d I do?These sentiments are rampant from industry women. Their envy &amp; resentment towards my noteriety is putrid, I’m told to “be grateful to porn,” and to “shut up and quit social media” if I’m unhappy. 

My sense of self pride doesn’t come from my felatio skills, I’m sorry yours does. https://t.co/UZOFFcxHNY@J_Overstreet14 I accept these terms 🤝@Michory I’ll get the tickets!

They already took everything else from me.@KaelebWilliams It didn’t feel too far from a reality, because major news organizations were flooding me with interview requests at the time. This was around the height of the controversy surrounding the hijab video.I feel bad for her living in such a deluded mindset to believe telling your own personal story &amp; fighting for vulnerable young women that don’t have a voice means you’re chasing clout. 

We are not the same. Stay in your toxic, narrow lane. https://t.co/wyTYMJywfS@KloppSZN_ Only acknowledging this because you’ve so clearly missed the whole point of the post. This instance was after the initial hijab scene.@mizdiabla1 I’m here for you ♥️@zoomerhippie I.... actually lol’d@5starcocaine @MariaPoetess Been talking about it for 5 years.@king_cooldazz This is a gross generalization that should not be perpetuated. I have never abused substances during or after my brief stint.@NoSuckerBets This tweet alone tells me she’s in good hands. You seem like an empathetic father, she’s very lucky to have you looking out for her. Just remember her choices aren’t a reflection of you. My dad was incredible and I had a close, loving upbringing.@blkkenyb It’s what the production company’s LLC was called. Venetian Studios is under the BangBros umbrella.@PeteIsntDunne Thank you for giving me a chance@MariaPoetess It’s a tricky line to walk... I don’t want to encourage women to enter, but I don’t want to put them down. I recently learned about ethical porn, and have finally found the balance on that tricky line: don’t reward the major production companies. Support the performers.Bc you walked into Venetian in 2014 “choosing your rate”? We started the same time- why are you putting me down for making industry standard? I’m not against sex work, I’m against the unethical treatment of MOST sex workers. Great to see you’re thriving tho, wish you the best 🤘🏼 https://t.co/9P8ON5iRu8For all I know, this photographer could’ve actually worked for Vogue. In which case, shame on him for abusing those credentials to explicitly photograph someone clearly in the throes of a crisis while the world ridiculed and watched, and these men capitalized on it.I was a pawn to them, they never  saw me as a human being with a soul and a future. They trafficked me into the hands of this man with no supervision or regards for my safety. I was not paid for that shoot. I was not informed what it would be used for. I had no control.Weeks later, those photos ended up being used on the website BangBros created under my name. Which I owned the domain for before they, again, deceived me into selling to them for $1.I was too young to realize at the time, but these men, all of them, collectively and consciously chose to deceive me. Jordan Sibbs, the Photogralher, other executives at Bang Bros, are all complicit. And I know for a fact they are because...My conclusion (after tons of therapy), is that it would not have mattered if this man was straight, gay, or even a female. I would have felt JUST as unsafe were it a woman in his place. The part of this whole thing that utterly crushes me, was the indignity of it.It is important to note that this man, to me, was sexually ambiguous. To this day, I do not know if he was gay, straight, or on any range of the sexuality spectrum. I have no idea. And it’s not important to me. I have been haunted by this for 6 long years.The worst part of it was when he moved his hands over my breasts telling me how nice they were. I still feel the cold metal from his rings in a shiver down my spine.When I wasn’t posing to his liking, he would physically correct me and contort my body until he was satisfied. I wanted to scream and cry and to claw his face off with my bare hands all at the same time.I dissociated. Instantly. I was fucking terrified. I felt cheap and used, powerless and demeaned.He told me to take the hijab and my underwear off and to pose against a wall. My heart began to palpatate. I know it might be easy for you to say “you had sex on camera, what’s the big deal?” But you need to understand the level of fear a woman has when she feels powerless.After he got the shots he wanted in the hijab, I thought we were done, so I started walking away to find my way back into the building, but he insisted the lighting was ideal for a few more shots he had in mind.His posing orders quickly scaled from provocative to salacious, but again, I was too afraid to say anything. “What if it IS for Vogue? What if he gets mad? What if he pushes you off the roof?” Was the chorus in my head. I didn’t know this man, and I was scared to my core.I was taken to roof of the building (industrial and barely accessible) ALONE with him. I was handed a hijab, &amp; two replica semi-automatic rifles. Following his orders, I put it on and posed for the photos the way he wanted, while he made physical corrections on my body.From the moment I was told there was no hair and makeup I knew something was off, but I was conflicted. I had never been on a “real” set, and I didn’t want to inadvertently insult the photographer or his process, because WHAT IF IT WAS GOING IN VOGUE!The photographers name, I believe, was Christian. I arrived at Bang Bros office HQ not knowing what to expect from a “real photographer,” thinking we would be going to a beautiful set or location.He told me I’d have the opportunity to be featured in mainstream publications and could really validate myself if I worked with this photographer. 

My eyes lit up, I was honored &amp; excited, I thought maybe this terrible situation I’m in could be parlayed into something positive.Following the whirlwind news cycle when the virality of the hijab video was at its peak, Bang Bros executive Jordan Sibbs told me his girlfriend’s relative was in town, a photographer for Vogue magazine.I’ve never spoken about this because I was made to feel as though I couldn’t tell my story without being derided by the general public. 

I feel safe now, and I also feel the need to unload some things that have haunted me during my brief stint in the industry.I implore you to hear my side of it as I’ve recounted in countless interviews since. 

I verbatim told them “you’re going to get me killed.” 

To which they responded with laughter and hopes of virality, and I was left humiliated for speaking up and too afraid to say more. https://t.co/P4KKLobep3I’m still losing my marbles over this support. I have never experienced this from the internet, and it’s so appreciated. My therapist is going to be so happy when I tell him about y’all ♥️ https://t.co/qBir0lb29TI’m begging you not to.

Venetian Studios is under the BangBros umbrella.@PeteIsntDunne Thank you for giving me a chance@MariaPoetess It’s a tricky line to walk... I don’t want to encourage women to enter, but I don’t want to put them down. I recently learned about ethical porn, and have finally found the balance on that tricky line: don’t reward the major production companies. Support the performers.Bc you walked into Venetian in 2014 “choosing your rate”? We started the same time- why are you putting me down for making industry standard? I’m not against sex work, I’m against the unethical treatment of MOST sex workers. Great to see you’re thriving tho, wish you the best 🤘🏼 https://t.co/9P8ON5iRu8For all I know, this photographer could’ve actually worked for Vogue. In which case, shame on him for abusing those credentials to explicitly photograph someone clearly in the throes of a crisis while the world ridiculed and watched, and these men capitalized on it.I was a pawn to them, they never  saw me as a human being with a soul and a future. They trafficked me into the hands of this man with no supervision or regards for my safety. I was not paid for that shoot. I was not informed what it would be used for. I had no control.Weeks later, those photos ended up being used on the website BangBros created under my name. Which I owned the domain for before they, again, deceived me into selling to them for $1.I was too young to realize at the time, but these men, all of them, collectively and consciously chose to deceive me. Jordan Sibbs, the Photogralher, other executives at Bang Bros, are all complicit. And I know for a fact they are because...My conclusion (after tons of therapy), is that it would not have mattered if this man was straight, gay, or even a female. I would have felt JUST as unsafe were it a woman in his place. The part of this whole thing that utterly crushes me, was the indignity of it.It is important to note that this man, to me, was sexually ambiguous. To this day, I do not know if he was gay, straight, or on any range of the sexuality spectrum. I have no idea. And it’s not important to me. I have been haunted by this for 6 long years.The worst part of it was when he moved his hands over my breasts telling me how nice they were. I still feel the cold metal from his rings in a shiver down my spine.When I wasn’t posing to his liking, he would physically correct me and contort my body until he was satisfied. I wanted to scream and cry and to claw his face off with my bare hands all at the same time.I dissociated. Instantly. I was fucking terrified. I felt cheap and used, powerless and demeaned.He told me to take the hijab and my underwear off and to pose against a wall. My heart began to palpatate. I know it might be easy for you to say “you had sex on camera, what’s the big deal?” But you need to understand the level of fear a woman has when she feels powerless.After he got the shots he wanted in the hijab, I thought we were done, so I started walking away to find my way back into the building, but he insisted the lighting was ideal for a few more shots he had in mind.His posing orders quickly scaled from provocative to salacious, but again, I was too afraid to say anything. “What if it IS for Vogue? What if he gets mad? What if he pushes you off the roof?” Was the chorus in my head. I didn’t know this man, and I was scared to my core.I was taken to roof of the building (industrial and barely accessible) ALONE with him. I was handed a hijab, &amp; two replica semi-automatic rifles. Following his orders, I put it on and posed for the photos the way he wanted, while he made physical corrections on my body.From the moment I was told there was no hair and makeup I knew something was off, but I was conflicted. I had never been on a “real” set, and I didn’t want to inadvertently insult the photographer or his process, because WHAT IF IT WAS GOING IN VOGUE!The photographers name, I believe, was Christian. I arrived at Bang Bros office HQ not knowing what to expect from a “real photographer,” thinking we would be going to a beautiful set or location.He told me I’d have the opportunity to be featured in mainstream publications and could really validate myself if I worked with this photographer. 

My eyes lit up, I was honored &amp; excited, I thought maybe this terrible situation I’m in could be parlayed into something positive.Following the whirlwind news cycle when the virality of the hijab video was at its peak, Bang Bros executive Jordan Sibbs told me his girlfriend’s relative was in town, a photographer for Vogue magazine.I’ve never spoken about this because I was made to feel as though I couldn’t tell my story without being derided by the general public. 

I feel safe now, and I also feel the need to unload some things that have haunted me during my brief stint in the industry.I implore you to hear my side of it as I’ve recounted in countless interviews since. 

I verbatim told them “you’re going to get me killed.” 

To which they responded with laughter and hopes of virality, and I was left humiliated for speaking up and too afraid to say more. https://t.co/P4KKLobep3I’m still losing my marbles over this support.
