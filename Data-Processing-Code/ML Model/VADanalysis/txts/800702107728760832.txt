Even your pathetic Customer Service can't give an answer. Why do you make such fake promises?@saurabhkanth786 @ANI I hope you are putting this up as a joke and not being serious.@godrejsecure First fix your product problems and customer issues, then talk about fixing corona. India has COVID WARRIORS fighting against the dreaded virus.@PrashantPandhi @Maruti_Corp @Maruti_Corp you should take this issue seriously and personally contact the OP to resolve the issue.@godrejsecure Your sincerity is highly insincere. You have lost a customer. With such attitude probably you would lose many more.Adding @godrejsecure @GodrejGroup please look into this. This should be resolved at the earliest since this is your product causing us : customers a hassle. I have been a good fan of your products for quite sometime. But the issue and response delays is really affecting this. https://t.co/QbgZMZySAP@godrejsecure @godrejsecure @GodrejGroup  still no response from you after sharing my details. When are you planning to contact?@godrejsecure Thanks I have shared the contact detail over private messagingThis is how poor the quality of the camera. TO confirm your points it is placed on roof-top, away from places where there can be a heavy splash of water. https://t.co/I2nC0pKeOCThe technician came in June and obviously he couldn't fix it nor replace it since it is  out of warranty by 2 monthsThis is really a poor service and frustration to customer as part of Godrej. Here's the link to product: https://t.co/jchFmCCVak@godrejsecure I had bought a Godrej 2MP camera whose warranty expired in January 2020. During lockdown in March, 2020 the waterproof camera stopped working. Is this the kind of product you have designed. How  is  it that a product  marketed as IP33 gets damaged by rainfall?@Lenovo_in Thanks @Lenovo_in I received my order finally. Big üëç to delivery service.

If I dont get an update of order dispatch within the next 2 days, please take the necessary steps to cancel this order.@Lenovo_in Highly disappointed with your service. I understand it is a pandemic situation and you are short handed, but you aren't  taking note of the rudimentary issues most consumers have been tweeting and resolving them like: Where is the order? In my city or in your warehoure.@Lenovo_in Give me a way to track my order, a fixed contact point.Your CC number in the website is responding to my call. Then how am I supposed to know where is my order? You should really think of this situation logically rather than being a 
corporate avarice.@Lenovo_in I dont care about EDDs@Lenovo_in @Lenovo_in @Lenovo Still not received. The last message I received was it will be shipped from the warehouse. Any update?@Lenovo_in FYI the name's Ipsit and my point is about the website being updated with my order which was mentioned in DM and is still not fixed.@Lenovo_in And why do I get this on my order Status page.

Even your pathetic Customer Service can't give an answer. Why do you make such fake promises?@saurabhkanth786 @ANI I hope you are putting this up as a joke and not being serious.@godrejsecure First fix your product problems and customer issues, then talk about fixing corona. India has COVID WARRIORS fighting against the dreaded virus.@PrashantPandhi @Maruti_Corp @Maruti_Corp you should take this issue seriously and personally contact the OP to resolve the issue.@godrejsecure Your sincerity is highly insincere. You have lost a customer. With such attitude probably you would lose many more.Adding @godrejsecure @GodrejGroup please look into this. This should be resolved at the earliest since this is your product causing us : customers a hassle. I have been a good fan of your products for quite sometime. But the issue and response delays is really affecting this. https://t.co/QbgZMZySAP@godrejsecure @godrejsecure @GodrejGroup  still no response from you after sharing my details. When are you planning to contact?@godrejsecure Thanks I have shared the contact detail over private messagingThis is how poor the quality of the camera. TO confirm your points it is placed on roof-top, away from places where there can be a heavy splash of water. https://t.co/I2nC0pKeOCThe technician came in June and obviously he couldn't fix it nor replace it since it is  out of warranty by 2 monthsThis is really a poor service and frustration to customer as part of Godrej. Here's the link to product: https://t.co/jchFmCCVak@godrejsecure I had bought a Godrej 2MP camera whose warranty expired in January 2020. During lockdown in March, 2020 the waterproof camera stopped working. Is this the kind of product you have designed. How  is  it that a product  marketed as IP33 gets damaged by rainfall?@Lenovo_in Thanks @Lenovo_in I received my order finally. Big üëç to delivery service.

I understand it is a pandemic situation and you are short handed, but you aren't  taking note of the rudimentary issues most consumers have been tweeting and resolving them like: Where is the order? In my city or in your warehoure.@Lenovo_in Give me a way to track my order, a fixed contact point.Your CC number in the website is responding to my call. Then how am I supposed to know where is my order? You should really think of this situation logically rather than being a 
corporate avarice.@Lenovo_in I dont care about EDDs@Lenovo_in @Lenovo_in @Lenovo Still not received. The last message I received was it will be shipped from the warehouse. Any update?@Lenovo_in FYI the name's Ipsit and my point is about the website being updated with my order which was mentioned in DM and is still not fixed.@Lenovo_in And why do I get this on my order Status page.
