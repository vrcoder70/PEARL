2020-06-07T09:17:45.000Z,@Lenovo_in Thanks @Lenovo_in I received my order finally. Big 👍 to delivery service. But please make sure that you update the details of order on portal. I still don't see that.
2020-05-30T16:07:19.000Z,"@Lenovo_in That is again some generic info. If I dont get an update of order dispatch within the next 2 days, please take the necessary steps to cancel this order."
2020-05-30T07:13:00.000Z,"@Lenovo_in Highly disappointed with your service. I understand it is a pandemic situation and you are short handed, but you aren't  taking note of the rudimentary issues most consumers have been tweeting and resolving them like: Where is the order? In my city or in your warehoure."
2020-05-30T07:08:35.000Z,"@Lenovo_in Give me a way to track my order, a fixed contact point.Your CC number in the website is responding to my call. Then how am I supposed to know where is my order? You should really think of this situation logically rather than being a 
corporate avarice."
